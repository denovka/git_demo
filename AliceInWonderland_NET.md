All in the golden afternoon
  Full leisurely we glide;
For both our oars, with little skill,
  By little arms are plied,
While little hands make vain pretence
  Our wanderings to guide.

Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
  Beneath such dreamy weather,
To beg a tale of breath too weak
  To stir the tiniest feather!
Yet what can one poor voice avail
  Against three tongues together?

Imperious Prima flashes forth
  Her edict 'to begin it' –
In gentler tone Secunda hopes
  'There will be nonsense in it!' –
While Tertia interrupts the tale
  Not more than once a minute.

Anon, to sudden silence won,
  In fancy they pursue
The dream-child moving through a land
  Of wonders wild and new,
In friendly chat with bird or beast –
  And half believe it true.

And ever, as the story drained
  The wells of fancy dry,
And faintly strove that weary one
  To put the subject by,
"The rest next time -" "It is next time!"
  The happy voices cry.

Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
  Thus slowly, one by one,
Its quaint events were hammered out –
  And now the tale is done,
And home we steer, a merry crew,
  Beneath the setting sun.

Alice! a childish story take,
  And with a gentle hand
Lay it were Childhood's dreams are twined
  In Memory's mystic band,
Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers
  Pluck'd in a far-off land.

## Chapter I  

DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE

ALICE was beginning to get very tired of  
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having  
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into  
the book her sister was reading, but it had no  
pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is

or two : wouldn’t it be murder to leave it  
behind?” She said the last words out loud, and  
the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off  
sneezing by this time). “ Don’t grunt,” said  
Alice : “ that ’s not at all a proper way of  
expressing yourself.”  
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked  
very anxiously into its face to see what was the  
matter with it. There could be no doubt that  
it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a  
snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were  
getting extremely small, for a baby : altogether  
Alice did not like the look of the thing at all,  
“ —but perhaps it was only sobbing,” she  
thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see  
if there were any tears.  
No, there were no tears. “ If you’re going to  
turn into a pig, my dear,” said Alice, seriously,  
“I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind  
now !” The poor little thing sobbed again, (or  
grunted, it was impossible to say which,) and  
they went on for some while in silence.
