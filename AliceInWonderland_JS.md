All in the golden afternoon
  Full leisurely we glide;
For both our oars, with little skill,
  By little arms are plied,
While little hands make vain pretence
  Our wanderings to guide.

Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
  Beneath such dreamy weather,
To beg a tale of breath too weak
  To stir the tiniest feather!
Yet what can one poor voice avail
  Against three tongues together?

Imperious Prima flashes forth
  Her edict 'to begin it' –
In gentler tone Secunda hopes
  'There will be nonsense in it!' –
While Tertia interrupts the tale
  Not more than once a minute.

Anon, to sudden silence won,
  In fancy they pursue
The dream-child moving through a land
  Of wonders wild and new,
In friendly chat with bird or beast –
  And half believe it true.

And ever, as the story drained
  The wells of fancy dry,
And faintly strove that weary one
  To put the subject by,
"The rest next time -" "It is next time!"
  The happy voices cry.

Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
  Thus slowly, one by one,
Its quaint events were hammered out –
  And now the tale is done,
And home we steer, a merry crew,
  Beneath the setting sun.

Alice! a childish story take,
  And with a gentle hand
Lay it were Childhood's dreams are twined
  In Memory's mystic band,
Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers
  Pluck'd in a far-off land.

## Chapter I  

DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE

ALICE was beginning to get very tired of  
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having  
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into  
the book her sister was reading, but it had no  
pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is

a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it  
was labelled “ ORANGE MARMALADE,” but  
to her great disappointment it was empty: she did  
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing some-  
body underneath, so managed to put it into  
one of the cupboards as she fell past it.  
“ Well !” thought Alice to herself, “ after  
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of  
tumbling down stairs ! How brave they ’ll all  
think me at home ! Why, I wouldn’t say any-  
thing about it, even if I fell off the top of  
the house !” (Which was very likely true.)  
Down, down, down. Would the fall never  
come to an end ? “ I wonder how many miles  
I ’ve fallen by this time ?” she said aloud. “ I  
must be getting somewhere near the centre of  
the earth. Let me see : that would be four  
thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see,  
Alice had learnt several things of this sort in  
her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this  
was not a very good opportunity for showing off  
her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to
