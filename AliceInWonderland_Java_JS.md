All in the golden afternoon
  Full leisurely we glide;
For both our oars, with little skill,
  By little arms are plied,
While little hands make vain pretence
  Our wanderings to guide.

Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
  Beneath such dreamy weather,
To beg a tale of breath too weak
  To stir the tiniest feather!
Yet what can one poor voice avail
  Against three tongues together?

Imperious Prima flashes forth
  Her edict 'to begin it' –
In gentler tone Secunda hopes
  'There will be nonsense in it!' –
While Tertia interrupts the tale
  Not more than once a minute.

Anon, to sudden silence won,
  In fancy they pursue
The dream-child moving through a land
  Of wonders wild and new,
In friendly chat with bird or beast –
  And half believe it true.

And ever, as the story drained
  The wells of fancy dry,
And faintly strove that weary one
  To put the subject by,
"The rest next time -" "It is next time!"
  The happy voices cry.

Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
  Thus slowly, one by one,
Its quaint events were hammered out –
  And now the tale is done,
And home we steer, a merry crew,
  Beneath the setting sun.

Alice! a childish story take,
  And with a gentle hand
Lay it were Childhood's dreams are twined
  In Memory's mystic band,
Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers
  Pluck'd in a far-off land.

## Chapter I  

DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE

ALICE was beginning to get very tired of  
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having  
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into  
the book her sister was reading, but it had no  
pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is

the trees behind him.  
“-or next day, maybe,” the Footman con-  
tinued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing  
had happened.  
“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again in  
a louder tone.  
“Are you to get in at all ?” said the Foot-  
man. “That’s the first question, you know.”  
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to  
be told so. “It’s really dreadful,” she muttered  
to herself, “ the way all the creatures argue.  
It’s enough to drive one crazy !”  
The Footman seemed to think this a good  
opportunity for repeating his remark, with  
variations. “ I shall sit here,” he said, “on and  
off, for days and days.”  
“But what am I to do?” said Alice.  
“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and  
began whistling.  
“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said  
Alice desperately : “he’s perfectly idiotic !” And  
she opened the door and went in.
